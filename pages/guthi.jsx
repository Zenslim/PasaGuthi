        <p className="text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto text-purple-300 mb-12">
          Guthi is not a login. Not a form.  
          It is an ancestral system for healing, belonging, and sacred continuity.  
          A soul-based DAO — encoded long before the blockchain.

            <h2 className="text-2xl mb-2">🪔 Guthi is the Original DAO</h2>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-300">
              Long before code, we had vows.  
              Guthi assigned roles, shared memory, and distributed land — trustlessly.  
              Your Guthi Key is not issued. It is remembered.

            <p className="text-sm text-gray-300">
              Bio, Psycho, Social, Spiritual — these are not wellness trends.  
              They were built into Guthi structure: through ritual, rhythm, and interdependence.

            <p className="text-sm text-gray-300">
              Every funeral, feast, and festival had a structure.  
              That was Guthi. Not governance — guardianship.  
              Not control — coherence.

            <p className="text-sm text-gray-300">
              Ikigai — your reason for being — needs roots.  
              Guthi gave each soul a role, a rhythm, a relationship.  
              No one was born without purpose.

            <p className="text-sm text-gray-300">
              Guthi is not history — it is architecture.  
              Culture encoded as protocol.  
              Rituals as modules. Identity as a shared memory ledger.

              From Bhaktapur to Boston, we carry the same seed.  
              Pasaguthi is the mycelium beneath us.  
              Scattered spores. Shared soul.
