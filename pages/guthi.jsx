        <p className="text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto text-purple-300 mb-12">
          Guthi is not just a key ‚Äî it is a remembrance of sacred order.  
          A living system for healing, belonging, and soul-powered regeneration.

          <Box emoji="üî±" title="Because Guthi Is the Original DAO">
            Long before blockchains, our ancestors distributed land, roles, and karma  
            through sacred vows and shared rituals. Guthi is decentralized. Sacred. Trustless ‚Äî but soul-bound.
          </Box>

          <Box emoji="üß¨" title="Because It Heals BPSS ‚Äî Bio, Psycho, Social, Spiritual">
            True health is not just physical. Guthi was designed to heal your breath, thoughts, relationships, and purpose.  
            Pasaguthi reawakens that model ‚Äî one presence at a time.
          </Box>

          <Box emoji="ü™î" title="Because It Is the Architecture of Belonging">
            From festivals to funerals, every sacred act was held by Guthi.  
            No one was alone. No moment was random. This is ancestral UX ‚Äî intuitive, meaningful, complete.
          </Box>

          <Box emoji="üå±" title="Because Ikigai Needs Roots">
            Purpose is not a luxury. It is survival.  
            Guthi doesn‚Äôt ask ‚ÄòWhat do you do?‚Äô It asks ‚ÄòWhy were you born here, now, among us?‚Äô
          </Box>

          <Box emoji="üåÄ" title="Because Scattered Souls Need a System">
            Diaspora, depression, burnout ‚Äî all are symptoms of disconnection.  
            Guthi is the reconnection protocol. Not an app. A memory system for your soul.
          </Box>

          <Box emoji="üé¥" title="Because Culture Is a Sacred Operating System">
            Guthi encoded language, ritual, service, and celebration.  
            It is not outdated ‚Äî it is encrypted. Pasaguthi is the decryption key.
