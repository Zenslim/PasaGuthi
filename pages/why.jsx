        <p className="text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto text-purple-300 mb-12">
          Pasaguthi is not just a platform. It is a sacred remembering.  
          A return to what our ancestors knew:  
          🧬 <em>Guthi is the soul of a civilization.</em>
        </p>

        <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 max-w-5xl mx-auto text-left">
          <Box title="Because We Were Never Just a Caste" emoji="🌿">
            Newars are not just an ethnicity — we are a living archive.  
            Artisans, priests, farmers, traders, warriors, mystics.  
            Our diversity is our design.
          </Box>

          <Box title="Because Guthi Is the Original DAO" emoji="🪔">
            Long before Web3, we shared land, memory, and responsibility  
            through sacred cooperatives.  
            Pasaguthi brings that back — not with tech hype, but soul alignment.
          </Box>

          <Box title="Because Scattered Threads Must Reweave" emoji="🌀">
            Newars are now everywhere — Boston, Berlin, Bhaktapur.  
            But our digital heart was missing. Until now.  
            Pasaguthi reconnects us — name, Thar, karma, purpose.
          </Box>

          <Box title="Because The Future Needs Roots" emoji="☀️">
            Our children need more than screens.  
            They need identity, rhythm, belonging, and myth.  
            Pasaguthi is their compass — grounded, glowing, and alive.
          </Box>

          <Box title="Because We Built Nepal — Literally" emoji="🛠️">
            Every carved strut in Patan, every brick of Bhaktapur, every celestial mandala in Kathmandu —  
            was laid by Newar hands. We are the architects of Nepal’s sacred geometry.  
            The builders of palaces, temples, and time itself.
          </Box>

          <Box title="Because We Measured Time in Stone" emoji="🧱">
            Our calendar — Nepal Sambat — outlives kings and empires.  
            We marked time not with wars, but with festivals, rituals, and sacred continuity.  
            Pasaguthi honors that rhythm.
          </Box>

          <Box title="Because We Protected Dharma with Tools, Not Swords" emoji="🔱">
            While others conquered with armies, Newars safeguarded culture through sculpture, urban design, and sacred rites.  
            Our legacy is not conquest — it is continuity. Not destruction — but design.

        <p className="mt-16 text-purple-400 text-md italic">

          Pasaguthi is not built. It is remembered.”
